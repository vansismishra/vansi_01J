        <div id="hist">India's space program began in the 1960s, shortly after the country gained independence. At that
            time, India was one of the poorest countries in the world, and its leaders recognized that a robust space
            program could help to address some of the country's most pressing challenges, including food security,
            communications, and national security.
            <br><br>
            The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) was established in 1969 under the leadership of Vikram
            Sarabhai, a prominent Indian scientist and industrialist. One of ISRO's first major achievements was the
            successful launch of the Aryabhata satellite in 1975, which made India the sixth country in the world to
            launch its own satellite.
            <br><br>
            Over the next several decades, ISRO continued to develop its capabilities in space technology, focusing on
            areas such as satellite communications, remote sensing, and meteorology. In 1983, India launched its first
            satellite for telecommunications, which helped to connect the country's remote areas and improve its
            communications infrastructure.
            <br><br>
            In the 1990s, ISRO began to focus on developing its launch vehicle technology, and in 1993 it successfully
            launched the PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle), which has since become one of the most reliable launch
            vehicles in the world. In 2008, ISRO achieved another major milestone when it successfully launched the
            Chandrayaan-1 mission, which made India the fourth country to reach the moon.
            <br><br>
            In recent years, ISRO has continued to expand its capabilities in space technology, with a particular focus
            on satellite-based navigation and Earth observation. In 2013, ISRO launched the Mangalyaan mission, which
            made India the first country to successfully reach Mars on its first attempt and at a fraction of the cost
            of other Mars missions. ISRO has also launched a series of successful remote sensing satellites, which have
            helped to improve agricultural productivity, disaster management, and national security.
            <br><br>
            Today, ISRO is recognized as one of the world's leading space agencies, and its achievements have helped to
            spur economic growth and technological development in India. <br><br>

                    <h2 class="hea">Chandrayaan-1</h2>Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar mission, launched on October 22, 2008,
                    by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The mission was aimed at conducting scientific
                    studies of the Moon, with a particular focus on mapping the Moon's surface, its mineral composition,
                    and the presence of water on the Moon.
                    <br>
                    The spacecraft was equipped with several scientific instruments, including a high-resolution camera,
                    a spectrometer, and a radar system. These instruments were used to gather data on the Moon's surface
                    and atmosphere, and to create detailed maps of the Moon's topography and mineral composition.
                    <br>
                    One of the major achievements of the Chandrayaan-1 mission was the discovery of evidence of water
                    molecules on the Moon. This discovery was made by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument, which
                    detected the presence of water molecules in the polar regions of the Moon.
                    <br>
                    The mission was originally planned to last for two years, but it was prematurely ended in August
                    2009, after the spacecraft lost communication with ground control. Despite this setback, the
                    Chandrayaan-1 mission was considered a major success, and it paved the way for India's future space
                    exploration efforts. <br>

                    <h2 class="hea">Mangalyaan</h2>Mangalyaan, also known as the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), was India's first interplanetary mission. It was launched on November 5, 2013, by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) with the objective of studying Mars' atmosphere, climate, geology, and potential for life.
                    <br>
                    Mangalyaan was designed to orbit Mars and study its atmosphere using scientific instruments such as the Mars Colour Camera (MCC), Mars Exospheric Neutral Composition Analyser (MENCA), and the Thermal Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (TIS). The mission also aimed to study the mineral composition of Mars using a Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA).
                    <br>
                    The mission was a major success for India, as it made India the first country to successfully reach Mars on its first attempt, and the fourth space agency in the world to reach the Red Planet. The spacecraft entered into orbit around Mars on September 24, 2014, and has been sending back valuable data since then.
                    <br>
                    The Mangalyaan mission was completed within a budget of approximately $75 million, which is significantly less than the cost of similar missions by other space agencies. This achievement demonstrated India's capability in space exploration and its ability to carry out complex space missions at a relatively low cost. <br>
